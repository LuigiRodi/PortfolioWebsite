            <article><p>Hello, world!<br>My name is Luigi and up until very recently I worked as an aircraft mechanic.
                I enjoyed the work for a time, but it would seem that the industry just is not for me. So, what does 
                one do when they are stuck in a career that they know is going nowhere? Well, they change it up! That's exactly 
                what I'm in the process of doing. This website represents my new career goals and what is quickly becoming my passion: 
                computer programming. Enjoy exploring my page and all the random stuff I manage to put up here.
